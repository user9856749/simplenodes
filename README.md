# simplenodes â€“ Version 2022/03/31

simplenodes is a TeX macro package for generating simple node base
flow graphs or diagrams, build upon the Ti*k*Z package.
The package provides two basic commands, one to generate a node and
one command to create links between them.
The positioning of the nodes is not handled by the package itself
but is preferably done in the tabular environment.

In total, 4 simple node types are defined, loosely based on the
nomenclature and color patterns of the popular java script bootstrap
(https://getbootstrap.com/).

See the file `simplenodes.pdf` for more information on the possibilities
and best use case of this package.
See the file `LICENSE` for license details.
